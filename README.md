# Translator - Translation extraction from any code to JSON files

*Translator* extracts all translatable terms of your project and places everything into a single JSON file that can be read from almost any programing language - including JavaScript.

It was originally designed to use in conjunction with multi-language SPA projects but is extensible to any kind of project that you are developing, whatever the source code language - if can reads JSON, will works.

## Features

- Written in Go Language and provided as package module
- Extracts terms from ``__()`` and ``translate()`` functions
- Supports plurals from ``__p()`` and ``pluralize()`` functions
- Supports terms extraction from custom patterns
- Reads terms from ``.js``, ``.html`` and ``.go`` files by default, but can include any other file extension
- Keeps already translated terms on the destination file
- Remove old terms that are not used anymore
- Can be use to extract and translate Go projects on the fly
- Just works!

)

translator := i18n.Context{
    Code:  "pt-BR",
    Alias: "pt",
    File:  "translations/pt-BR.json",

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
